## üìã Next Steps

### To Complete Implementation:

1. **Implement Defect Form (Form 2)**

     - Aircraft Information (registration, make, model)
     - Engine Details
     - Propeller Details
     - Attachments

2. **Implement Accident/Incident Form (Form 1)**
   - Use FormWizard for 3-page flow:

   - Implement all 80+ fields from `docs/accident_fields.json`
   - Add conditional sections (bird strike, near collision)

3. **Configure Zoho WorkDrive**
   - Get WorkDrive API credentials
   - Create/identify folder for file storage
   - Update .env with WorkDrive credentials

4. **Testing**
   - Test member validation
   - Test file uploads
   - Test form submissions to CRM
   - Verify data mapping

## üîß Technical Notes

### Tailwind CSS v4
- Using new @tailwindcss/postcss plugin
- Updated postcss.config.js accordingly

### Next.js Configuration
- Server external packages configured for axios
- Webpack fallbacks for Node.js modules

### TypeScript

- Target ES2017 for top-level await

## üêõ Known Issues

1. Production build has some warnings (non-critical)
2. WorkDrive credentials need to be configured
3. Forms 1 & 2 need full implementation

## ‚ú® Next Development Session

Start by implementing the Defect form (Form 2) using the Complaint form as a reference. The structure and patterns are all in place - just need to add the specific fields and validation logic.
