## Zoho API Setup

### Step 1: Create API Client

1. Go to [Zoho API Console](https://api-console.zoho.com.au/)
2. Click **"Add Client"** â†’ **"Server-based Applications"**
3. Fill in details:
   - **Client Name**: RAAus Forms
   - **Homepage URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
   - **Authorized Redirect URIs**: `http://localhost:3000/oauth/callback`
4. Click **"CREATE"**
5. Copy **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### Step 2: Update .env with Credentials

```bash
ZOHO_CRM_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
ZOHO_CRM_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here

ZOHO_WORKDRIVE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here  # Same as CRM
ZOHO_WORKDRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here  # Same as CRM
```

### Step 3: Generate Combined Refresh Token

The token generator requests these scopes:
- `ZohoCRM.modules.ALL` - CRM access
- `WorkDrive.files.ALL` - WorkDrive file operations
- `WorkDrive.workspace.ALL` - WorkDrive workspace access

**Generate Token:**

```bash
# Step 1: Get authorization URL
npm run zoho:token

# Step 2: Open the URL in browser, authorize, and copy the code from redirect
# Redirect URL: http://localhost:3000/oauth/callback?code=YOUR_CODE

# Step 3: Generate refresh token
npm run zoho:token YOUR_CODE_HERE
```

**Update .env:**

```bash
ZOHO_CRM_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token_here
ZOHO_WORKDRIVE_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token_here  # Same token!
```

### Step 4: Get WorkDrive Folder ID

1. Go to [Zoho WorkDrive](https://workdrive.zoho.com.au)
2. Create a folder: **"RAAus Form Attachments"**
3. Open the folder and copy the ID from URL:
   ```
   https://workdrive.zoho.com.au/folder/wi3c6bb69a60ccee14c828111a1c46e1f3faa
                                            â†‘ This is your Folder ID
   ```
4. Add to .env:
   ```bash
   ZOHO_WORKDRIVE_FOLDER_ID=wi3c6bb69a60ccee14c828111a1c46e1f3faa
   ```
