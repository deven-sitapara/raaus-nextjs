## 🔧 Remaining Manual Actions

### Quick Start Cleanup

Run this command to identify remaining console.log statements:

```bash
npm run cleanup:logs
```

This will scan your codebase and show you exactly where console.log statements are located.

### Priority Actions

1. **Review Console Logs** (5-10 minutes)
   - Run `npm run cleanup:logs`
   - Remove debug logs from production files
   - Keep `console.error` and `console.warn` for error tracking

2. **Test Production Build** (2-3 minutes)
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

3. **Validate Environment Variables** (2 minutes)
   - Check `.env` file has all required variables
   - Verify Zoho credentials are correct

## 🔐 Security Status

### ✅ Secure
- All API keys in environment variables
- No hardcoded credentials
- Server-side API calls only
- Input validation (client + server)
- Type-safe TypeScript

### ✅ Best Practices
- Token caching (reduces API calls)
- Error messages don't expose internals
- CORS handled by Next.js
- File upload size limits enforced

---

## 📈 Performance Status

### ✅ Optimized
- Token caching (55-minute expiry)
- Form data persistence
- Memoized React components
- Dynamic imports for maps
- Next.js Image optimization
- Code splitting (App Router)

### Metrics (Expected)
- **First Load**: < 3s
- **Form Submission**: 2-5s (depends on Zoho API)
- **File Upload**: Varies by file size
- **Page Navigation**: < 500ms
